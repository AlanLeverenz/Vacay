# Vacay
Web app for providing a snapshot of information to a traveler for selected countries. With a single click the web app displays cards with country stats (capital city, language, currency, flag, population, times zones, etc.), current weather, the country currency with a default quote against the USD, a currency converter, recent NY Times articles pertaining to the country, and an itinerary that is stored in Firebase. 

There are four API's at work in this web app.

1) Country Data. https://restcountries.eu

2) Google Maps. https://www.google.com/maps

3) AcccuWeather. https://dataservice.accuweather.com.

4) Currency. https://data.fixer.io.

This is the first team project for the CU Bootcamp Full Stack course.
